Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code 
Step 2: Install the Python Extnsion for VSC
Step 3: Install Git onto your computer. https://git-scm.com/
Step 4: Type git clone https://github.com/SubZero1296/Python-for-Market-Anaylsis- into your terminal 
Step 5: Type in cd <repository-name> make sure you replace <repository-name> with the name of the directory that was created by the git clone command within your terminal as well. 
Step 6: Install all the needed extensions with the pip install -r requirements.txt command in your terminal 
Step 7: Now you can run any of the four codes by merely typing in their file names. I reccomend using phase_four.py in the terminal as it will give all the info required. So,  you will now need to open your terminal and type python phase_four.py in your terminal
Step 8: You should now have all the info needed. 

Extra info:
phase_one.py has all the info for only one book. You can run this, but you will need to change the URL to whichever book you would like to find on bookstoscrape.com
phase_two.py has all the categories. Again to change this you will need to change the URL to another category main page URL
phase_three is for the whole websites books so no changes are necessary. 
phase_four is the same as three but it also will save all image files on your machine locally.
